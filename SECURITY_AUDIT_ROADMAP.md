## üîç **PHASE 2: IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **2.1 Vulnerability Classification Matrix**

| **Vulnerability Type** | **Potential Impact** | **Severity** | **Affected Data** | **Unauthorized Actions** |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Authentication Bypass | High | Critical | All user data | Full system access |
| SQL Injection | High | Critical | Database contents | Data manipulation |
| XSS | Medium | High | User sessions | Account takeover |
| CSRF | Medium | Medium | User actions | Unauthorized operations |
| Rate Limit Bypass | Low | Medium | System resources | DoS attacks |

### **2.2 Impact Assessment Checklist**
For each identified vulnerability:
- [ ] **Data Exposure Risk**
  - [ ] What user data could be accessed?
  - [ ] Could poll results be manipulated?
  - [ ] Are authentication credentials at risk?
  - [ ] Could personal information be leaked?

- [ ] **Unauthorized Actions**
  - [ ] Could attackers create fake polls?
  - [ ] Can votes be cast without authorization?
  - [ ] Could user accounts be compromised?
  - [ ] Are administrative functions accessible?

- [ ] **Business Impact**
  - [ ] Could poll integrity be compromised?
  - [ ] Would user trust be affected?
  - [ ] Are there compliance implications?
  - [ ] Could the service be disrupted?
