# Database Setup Instructions

To fix the authentication user display issue, you need to set up the database tables in your Supabase project.

## Steps to Set Up the Database

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Sign in to your account
   - Select your project: `uzosbufoolfljzfgtsqj`

2. **Run the Database Setup Script**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor**
   - Copy the contents of `database-setup.sql` file
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click **Run** to execute the script

3. **Verify Tables are Created**
   - Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
   - You should see three tables: `users`, `polls`, and `votes`

## Testing Authentication

After setting up the database:

1. **Register a New User**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/auth/register`
   - Fill in the form with:
     - Name: Test User
     - Email: test@example.com
     - Password: TestPassword123!
   - Click "Sign Up"

2. **Verify User Display**
   - After successful registration, you should be redirected to the home page
   - The navigation bar should show "Welcome, Test User" or "Welcome, test@example.com"
   - Check the browser console for debug logs

3. **Test Login**
   - Sign out and try logging in with the same credentials
   - Verify the user information is displayed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see the user information:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for console logs starting with "Auth state change:" and "Current user data:"

2. **Check Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to **Authentication** > **Users** to see if the user was created
   - Go to **Table Editor** > **users** to see if the user record exists

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for any failed API requests to Supabase
   - Verify the environment variables are correct

## Current Issue

The authentication system is working, but the user information is not being displayed in the UI. This is likely because:

1. The database tables don't exist (fixed by running the setup script)
2. The user record isn't being created in the `users` table during registration
3. There's a timing issue with the auth state updates

The debug logs added to the auth context will help identify the exact issue.
